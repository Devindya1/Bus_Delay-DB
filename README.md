# Bus_Delay-DB
Create a DB to analyze, store and managed the bus delays.
Public bus delays are a common problem faced by many passengers, especially in busy
towns and cities. These delays not only cause inconvenience for daily commuters but also
affect the overall reliability of public transportation. Understanding why these delays
happen and when they are most likely to occur can help improve the bus system for
everyone.

This project aims to create a database system that collects and manages data related to bus
operations. The system will keep track of important details such as:
- Bus routes and assigned buses
- Scheduled and actual arrival/departure times
-  Driver information
- Delay records and possible causes (e.g., traffic)
  
By analyzing this data, we hope to answer questions like:
- Which routes experience the most delays?
- At what times of day are delays most common?
- Are there specific drivers or traffic conditions linked to repeated delays?
  
The main goals of this project are:
- To track and compare planned vs. actual bus schedules
- To analyze delay patterns across different times, drivers, and routes
- To generate useful reports that can help transportation authorities make better
decisions

This system could be expanded to support real-time monitoring and alerts in the long term.
This case study focuses on developing a foundational database system designed to store,
analyze, and report delay-related data in public bus services.
